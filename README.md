# Learning GSAP

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) transformed my approach to web animations. This powerful JavaScript library makes it simple to create smooth, professional animations. Through hands-on learning, I discovered key features like Timeline animations, ScrollTrigger capabilities, and Tweens.

Getting started was straightforward:

```javascript

gsap.to(".element", {
    duration: 1,
    x: 100,
    rotation: 360,
    ease: "power2.out"
});
